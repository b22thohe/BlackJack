# What this is

In preparation for a university level course in C#.NET I decided to create a very crude Black Jack game. There was never any intention to implement all the rules of the game.
The project showcases basic game logic, multiple forms and file loading/saving.

## What this does
In the current version 1.0 the application allows 2 people to play multipe rounds of Black Jack. The game keeps track of number of wins/losses and number of Black Jacks.<br><br>
Statistics can be saved and loaded for each player individually.

## What is left to do
If, and when, I get around to it I plan to fix the bug where the main view stats do not update upon statistics load. The next feature in line would be to implement a computer player
